# Flashcard-Generator

This flashcard generator is the backend implementation for generating a basic flashcard question, and for 
generating a flashcard with a cloze deletion. Although the full card for each is console logged, front-end
implementations were not truly considered except as a means of testing card generation. It uses constructors
to create new cards.

To make a Basic Card:
You must enter a question followed by a question mark. After the question mark you must enter the answer

To make a Cloze Card:
You must enter a statement of fact followed by a period. After the period, you must indicate the cloze
deletion phrase by re-typing it.
